## 📦 Arrays

Arrays are the **foundation of Data Structures** and are heavily used
in coding interviews, system design, and AI/ML data pipelines.

This section focuses on:
- Safe array traversal
- Index vs value understanding
- In-place vs extra space trade-offs
- Building intuition for advanced patterns

### What I Learned
- Iterating over arrays using loops
- Applying conditions on elements
- Tracking minimum / maximum values
- Reversing arrays using logic (not shortcuts)

### Interview Relevance
Arrays are used in:
- Almost every coding interview
- Feature vectors in ML
- Data preprocessing pipelines
- Foundations of advanced DSA topics
