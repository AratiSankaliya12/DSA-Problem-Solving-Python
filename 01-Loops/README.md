## 🔁 Loops & Iterative Thinking

This section focuses on mastering **iteration-based logic** using loops.

### What I Learned
- Using `for` and `while` loops effectively
- Controlling loop start, end, and step
- Writing accumulation-based logic
- Avoiding infinite loops and off-by-one errors

### Common Mistakes
- Incorrect range boundaries
- Forgetting to update loop variables
- Misplaced conditions inside loops

### Interview Relevance
Loops are heavily used in:
- Array and string traversal
- Frequency counting
- Data processing in AI pipelines
- Dynamic programming foundations
